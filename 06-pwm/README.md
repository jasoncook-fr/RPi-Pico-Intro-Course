## pwm-fade example
**Using a single LED we will fade the luminosity on and off in a loop** <br />
PWM is short for __Pulse-Width Modulation__ <br />
PWM gives the impression of creating an analog signal since we work with output values ranging beyond 1 or 0. <br />
Where one may believe that we are changing the luminosity of an LED, the reality is that we are blinking it so fast that it deceives our eyes. <br />
<br />
The diagram below illustrates this. Where the red line is what we think we see, The blue line illustrates what is actually happening:
