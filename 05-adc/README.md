## adc example
Using a potentiometer we will introduce the use of analog sensors <br/>
Modules used in _adc.py_ code:
- _ADC_ and _Pin_ from _machine_
- _sleep_ from _utime_ 

ADC is short for __Analog to Digital Coversion__

<br />
A potentiometer is an analog device, more precisely it is a variable resistor. As with other analog sensors, we may introduce a potentiometer to a microcontroller to obtain a range of values exceeding only 1 or 0.

Connections and schematic as follows:

### Hookup guide:

__ALWAYS ADD A RESISTOR FOR THE LED!__ (220 or 330 ohm for example)
