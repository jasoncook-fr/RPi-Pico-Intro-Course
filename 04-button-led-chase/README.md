## button-led-chase example
**With a push-button we illustrate the basic use of a GPIO pin as INPUT** <br />
The 10KÎ© resistor on the breadboard is removed for use of internal pull-down resistor<br />
When the button is pressed, a for loop is implemented to sequence 3 LEDs turning on and off. <br />
<br />
_for_ loops are traditionally used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times.
