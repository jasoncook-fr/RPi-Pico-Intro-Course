## Getting started with Micropython on the Raspberry Pico

### In this repository are included examples as follows <br/>

| IO Function         | Exercise                               |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| OUTPUT              | Blink a LED                            |

| INPUT & OUTPUT      | sequence 3 LEDs at push of a button    |
| ADC                 | add a potentiometer for analog input   |
| PWM                 | create varied luminosity of a LED      |
| PWM                 | automated control of a Servo motor     |
| PWM & ADC           | control a Servo motor with analog input|
