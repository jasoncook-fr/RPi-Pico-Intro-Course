## Blink example
**Example using micropython on the Raspberry Pico. 3 LEDs are animated in sequence, building on the first example, using a single LED** <br />
We move on to use only the functions we need from modules instead of calling the entire module. This limits our amount of typing in the whole of the code.
Functions used from modules:
- Pin from machine
- sleep from utime
